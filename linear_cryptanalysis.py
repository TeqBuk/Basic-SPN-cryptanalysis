# must hold with a probability of 15/32
# We can leverage this approximation to recover bits of the last subkey (K_5)

# Extracting key bits: checking target partial subkey bits
#
# target partial subkey bits are the bits from the last subkey associated with the S-boxes in
# the last round influenced by the data bits involved in the linear approximation
# the correct partial subkey value will result in the linear approximation holding with a probability 
# significantly different from 0.5


#For all possible values of the target partial subkeys, the corresponding
#ciphertext bits are exclusive-ORed with the bits of the target partial subkey and the result
#is run backwards through the corresponding S-boxes. 

#This is done for all known plaintext/ciphertext samples and a count is kept for each value of the target partial
#subkey. The count for a particular target partial subkey value is incremented when the
#linear expression holds true for the bits into the last roundâ€™s S-boxes (determined by the
#partial decryption) and the known plaintext bits. 

#The target partial subkey value which has the count which differs the greatest from half the number of plaintext/ciphertext
#samples is assumed to represent the correct values of the target partial subkey bits. This
#works because it is assumed that the correct partial subkey value will result in the linear
#approximation holding with a probability significantly different from 1/2. 

#An incorrect subkey is assumed to result in a relatively random guess at the bits entering the S-boxes of the last round and as a result, the linear
#expression will hold with a probability close to 1/2.

#The linear expression U_4,6 ^ U_4,8 ^ U_4,14 ^ U_4,14 ^ U_4,16 ^ P_5 ^ P_7 ^ P_8 = 0 affects the
#inputs to S-boxes S_4,2 and S_4,4 in the last round. For each plaintext/ciphertext sample, we
#would try all 256 values for the target partial subkey [K_5,5 ...K_5,8 , K_5,13 ...K_5,16 ]. 

#For each partial subkey value, we would increment the count whenever equation (5) holds true,
#where we determine the value of [U_4,5 ...U_4,8 , U_4,13 ...U_4,16 ] by running the data backwards
#through the target partial subkey and S-boxes S_2,4 and S_4,4 . The count which deviates the
#largest from half of the number of plaintext/ciphertext samples is assumed to the correct
#value.

#We have simulated attacking our basic cipher by generating 10000 known
#plaintext/ciphertext values and following the cryptanalytic process described for partial
#subkey values [K 5,5 ...K 5,8 ] = [0010] (hex 2) and [K 5,13 ...K 5,16 ] = [0100] (hex 4). As
#expected, the count which differed the most from 5000 corresponded to target partial
#subkey value [2,4] hex , confirming that the attack has successfully derived the subkey bits.
#Table 5 highlights a partial summary of the data derived from the subkey counts. (The
#complete data involves 256 data entries, one for each target partial subkey value.) The
#values in the table indicate the bias magnitude derived from
